"""Naralabs task: Managing samples.

The creation of the constants folder is to save a set 
of files that are related to constant values. 
In messages.py are saved the constants which are used as output
in the cases that the api functions correctly or gives error.
This is done because in the case that the application is increasing in size 
it is better and faster to keep the messages.
